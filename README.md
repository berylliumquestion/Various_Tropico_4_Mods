# Various_Tropico_4_Mods
Just a collection of mods I've made so far.

If you're new to this whole modding Tropico thing as I was make sure to add the directories as in this repo to your Tropico 4 folder. As in, if the mod you're looking for is, for example, in the game folder, make sure to have game folder in your Tropico 4 folder.

I made BetterDescriptions because there's quite a few errors in the tooltips. Currently in development.
