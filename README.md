# Various_Tropico_4_Mods
Just a collection of mods I've made so far.

No more needing to fiddle around with game folders or any such. Just use the Installer!

I made BetterDescriptions because there's quite a few errors in the tooltips. Currently in development.

NoFreeImmigrantsMeansNoFreeImmigrants is a solution to a problem that I've been having for a while. If you're wanting to play as a true isolationist this is the mod for you. The nationalists would be quite pleased with you. If you still want minister events, you can take the lua file and install it manually in the latest dlc folder. WARNING: Current implementation of this may cause citizens to glitch in random unpredictable ways. Manually install NoFreeImmigrantsMeansNoFreeImmigrants.lua to Tropico 4\NuclearTakedown\game\NoFreeImmigrantsMeansNoFreeImmigrants.lua to avoid that.
